# TodoApp with API

Welcome to the React TypeScript Todo App! This project is a simple yet powerful todo application built with React, TypeScript, and various modern web technologies. It serves as a great example of how to structure a React application with TypeScript and showcases the use of animations, state management, and API integration.

- **Filter Todos**: Easily filter your tasks by their status - All, Active, or Completed.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for adding and removing todos using `react-transition-group`.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error notifications for API failures or invalid inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and responsive UI built with Bulma CSS framework.

## Technologies Used
